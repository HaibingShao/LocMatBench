# Version of the Blaze library:
#   debug  : Debug version
#   release: Release version (default)
VERSION="release"

# Library configuration:
# This selection configures which libraries are created during the compilation process. Note
# that in case both the static and shared library are built the static library also consists
# of position-independent code. Note also that any change of this setting may require a clean
# up via 'make clean'.
#   static: Only create the static Blaze library (default)
#   shared: Only create the shared Blaze library
#   both  : Create both static and shared library
LIBRARY="static"

# Compiler selection:
#   gcc  : GCC compiler (default)
#   intel: Intel compiler
COMPILER="gcc"

# Special compiler flags:
# This setting offers the option to pass additional, specific flags to the compiler.
COMPILER_FLAGS=

# Specification of the cache size:
# Via this setting it is possible to specify the size of the outermost cache level. It
# influences the choice of the evaluation strategy of mathematical expression to achieve
# the highest possible performance. The value must be given in Bytes. For instance, a
# 3 MiByte cache must be specified as "3145728". If no cache size is specified, a cache
# of 3 MiByte is assumed.
CACHE_SIZE=

# Configuration of the boost library
# The boost library (see www.boost.org) is precondition for the Blaze library, i.e., it
# is not possible to compile the library without boost. Blaze requires you to have at
# least the boost version 1.39.0 or higher installed on your system. In case the boost
# include directory is not set, it is assumed that the boost headers are installed in
# standard paths (as for instance '/usr/include/boost').
BOOST_INCLUDE_PATH=

# Configuration of the BLAS library (optional)
# The Blaze library offers the possibilty to use a BLAS library for certain basic linear
# algebraic operations (such as for instance matrix-matrix multiplications). If the BLAS
# switch is set to 'yes', the library expects the according headers in order to compile
# properly. In case the BLAS include directory is not set, it is assumed that the header
# file 'cblas.h' is installed in standard paths (as for instance '/usr/include/cblas.h').
# Additionally, in case the name of the BLAS include file is not set, it is assumed that
# the BLAS include file is named 'cblas.h'.
BLAS="no"
BLAS_INCLUDE_PATH=
BLAS_INCLUDE_FILE=

# Configuration of the MPI library (optional)
# If set to 'yes' the MPI parallel execution of the Blaze library will be activated. If
# set to 'yes' and in case the MPI include directory is not explicitly specified it is
# assumed that the MPI headers are installed in standard paths.
#   yes: Activation of the MPI parallelization
#   no : Deactivation of the MPI parallelization (default)
MPI="no"
